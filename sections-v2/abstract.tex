    Systems for collecting, storing and analyzing data are increasingly necessary with each technological evolution. The biomedical and laboratory areas are no exception, and there are specialized systems for this type of function: LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System).

    LIMS based on workflows are systems that models an organization's workflow and make this process available so that users can perform their jobs efficiently, orderly and quickly, keeping information in the system so that other users can access it.

    However, these complex systems store all the information of the organizations that use them and, as there is a lot of data being stored, the system needs to make them available in the most intuitive way possible.
    This work proposes implementations that change the BPM model built in the system to centralize the user's focus on an activity, facilitating access to the information required at the time.

    The ability to share information between workflows was also implemented so that teams can communicate entirely through the system, reducing the incidence of errors when communication between teams is necessary.

    These implementations are in being used in several systems with benefits for users. In particular, we mention the workflow CTTX, which was unified with the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) workflow for sharing information on the equipment used. We also mention the dynamic visualization of the CENTRARE workflow, used in the hospital "Hospital da Baleia", to facilitate the search for information within the workflow.
